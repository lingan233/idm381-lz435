                                <li class="px-5 py-1">No, the software is not making the best use of the hardware because this game is overall not as interesting using the rock paper scissor game mechanic. The rock paper scissor is not a meaningful interaction; instead, it is used as a pure hand spell. It is the “Same O Same O” for a regular adventure game but managed to add the leap motion and the rock paper scissors.</li>
